# -------------- SYNTAX  ---------------

if 5 > 2 :
    print("five is greater than two!")
# This is a basic if condition
# If the condition (5 > 2) is True, the indented code runs

# ------------- SYNTAX ERROR-----------

# if 5 > 2 :
# print("5 is greater than 2 ")
# This will cause a syntax error because:
# Python uses indentation to define blocks
# print() must be indented under the if statement

if 5 > 2 :
    print("5 is greater than 2")
    if 10 > 4 :
        print("10 is greater than 4")
# Nested if statement
# The inner if runs only when the outer if condition is True

x = 5
# Integer variable

y = "hello world"
# String variable

print("python is fun ")
print("hello world")
print("have a good day")
print("learning python is fun !")
# Each print() outputs text on a new line by default

print("hello"); print("how are you"); print("bye-bye!")
# Multiple print statements can be written in one line using semicolon

print('hii .. from hitaishi')
# Strings can be written using single quotes or double quotes

print(3)
# Printing a number (no quotes, so it is an integer)

print("hello world!", end=" ")
# end=" " prevents a new line after printing
# Output cursor stays on the same line

print("hello world!", end=" ")
# This will continue printing on the same line

# AFTER " END " EVERYTHING WILL WRITTEN IN SAME LINE
